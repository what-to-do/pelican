I want to create a filtering system like the one below:

http://www.autozone.com/searchresult?searchText=windshield%20wiper&vehicleSetFromSearch=false&keywords=windshield%20wiper

Inventory will need to be done through php and MySQL, but the filtering system can get done through jquery/html/css.

I'm currently working on a similiar filtering system for my work. I plan to complete it by next week.
